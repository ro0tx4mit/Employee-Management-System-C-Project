# Employee Management System Project Requirements

## 1. C Compiler
   - You need a C compiler installed on your machine. GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is recommended.

## 2. Command Line Interface (CLI) or Terminal
   - Access to a command line interface or terminal is required to compile and run the C program.

## 3. Git (Optional)
   - If you plan to clone the project repository, Git is needed. Alternatively, you can download the project as a zip file.

# Steps to Set Up and Run the Project:

## 1. Clone the Repository (Optional):
   - If you have Git installed, you can clone the project repository using the following command:
     ```
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can download the project as a zip file from the repository.

## 2. Navigate to Project Directory:
   - Change your current working directory to the location where you cloned or extracted the project.

## 3. Compile the Source Code:
   - Use the C compiler (GCC) to compile the source code. For example:
     ```
     gcc -o employee-management-system main.c
     ```

## 4. Run the Executable:
   - After successful compilation, run the executable file:
     ```
     ./employee-management-system
     ```

## 5. Follow On-Screen Prompts:
   - The program will present a menu with different modules. Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the modules, add, edit, delete, or view employee information.

Ensure that your system meets these requirements, and you should be able to compile and run the Employee Management System project successfully.
